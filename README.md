### Namaste!,

Collaborative, Competitive, Curious.

I work professionally as a Full-Stack Web App Developer.

- Majorly, I write code in C#, Python, Go, TypeScript, JavaScript,SQL.
- I have worked professionally on web application projects and got the opportunity to work in the team of Senior Developer having years of experience in engineering scalable systems which are used concurrently by hundreds and thousands of users all over the world.
- I have gotten hands-on experience with Frontend <-> Backend <-> DevOps for which I am grateful to my current employer.
Recently I found about Open-Source Contribution, and I am grateful that I did because I have learnt more about software engineering from OSC than anything else I ever tried.
- I joke on Twitter like Elon but only about the dev stuff but I do not joke on LinkedIn.
