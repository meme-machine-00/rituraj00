### Namaste hackers,

I identify myself as `hacker`.

I work professionally as a `Full-Stack Web Application Developer`.

- I use C#, Python and Go at the backend and TypeScript and JavaScript at the frontend.
- I also contribute in Open Source and trust me you should too.
- I am trying to beat Elon Musk on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rajritu001) and Bill Gates on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rituraj001/)
- Always learning in public.
