### Namaste hackers,

I identify myself as hacker, my pronoun is 'the one who will not hack someone's social media for you'.

I work professionally as a `Full-Stack Cross-Platform Application Developer`.

- Majorly, I write code in C#, Python, Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, Flutter.
- I have worked professionally on web applicaton projects and got the opportunity to work in the team of Senior Developer having years of experience in engineering scalable systems which are used concurrently by hundreds and thousands of users all over the world.
- I have gotten my hands dirty from Frontend <-> Backend <-> DevOps thanks to my employer and I am grateful for that.
- Recently I found about Open Source Contribution and I am grateful that I did because I have learnt more about software engineering from OSC than anything else I ever tried. Contributing to [Bitwarden](https://github.com/bitwarden/) open-source project.
- I joke on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rajritu001) like Elon but only about the dev stuff and I do not joke on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rituraj001/).
- `#LearnInPublic`
