### Namaste hackers,

I identify myself as `hacker` because its cool 😎.

I worked professionally as a `Full-Stack Web Application Developer`.

- 💻 I also contribute in Open Source and I learnt it is the best way to advance your skills
- I talk 🐍 `python`, write 🖊️`Go`, read ☑️`TypeScript` and joke in 😆`JavaScript` and I don't know why I put this into my bio.
- I share my thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rajritu001)
