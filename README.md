### Namaste hackers,

I identify myself as hacker, my pronoun is 'the one who will not hack someone's social media for you'.

I work professionally as a `Full-Stack Cross-Platform Application Developer`.

- Majorly, I write code in C#, Python, Go, TypeScript, JavaScript.
- I am aware with working of many frameworks mostly ASP.NET Core, Angular10+, React.JS, Node.JS, Django, Flask, Jest, xUnit, Express.JS, Next.JS, Angular.JS. 
- My prompt skills are good as I frequently play with new AI tools like ChatGPT.
- Science & Tech content creation. 
- I have worked professionally on multiple web applicaton projects from where I got the opportunity to work with the team of Senior Developer having years of experience in engineering scalable systems which are used concurrently by hundreds-thousands of users all over the world.
- I have gotten hands-on experience in the trinity Frontend <-> Backend <-> DevOps, thanks to my employer and I am grateful.
- Recently, started contributing in Open Source projects and preparing to start one open source project of my own too. 
- I joke on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rajritu001) like Elon but only about the dev stuff and I do not joke on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rituraj001/).
